# Personal Rust Cli

This project started from following along the Youtube channel "Let's Get Rusty",
and their series on [building a rust CLI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYkiwsplDTg),
with some modifications to the project structure.

Future features will be my own, built on top of this framework.

## Usage

- minigrep \<query> \<filename>
  - Prints all lines in the given file containing the provided query string.
